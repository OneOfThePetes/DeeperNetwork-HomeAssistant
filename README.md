# DeeperNetwork-HomeAssistant

This solution requires the HA Community addon "SSH & Web Terminal" (not "Terminal & SSH"), and also requires passwordless SSH set up with a public and private key. 

This is because the HA container cannot handle OpenSSL which is needed to encode your password before sending it to the deeper device to login.

I used PuttyGen to generate my key pair - and also used PuttyGen to convert my .ppk file to a .pem file.

Rename, and store the SSH private key (HA-Private.pem) and SSH public key in (HA-Public.pub) /config/keys/SSH

Store the deeper device public key (deeper.pub) in /config/keys/deeper

Password is stored in /config/secrets.yaml like this: 

deeper_password: YoUr-P@55w0rd
